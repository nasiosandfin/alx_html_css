# Headphones Landing Page 🎧

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development Program**.  
The goal is to **implement a design from scratch** using only **HTML and CSS** (no external frameworks or libraries). The final webpage must replicate the provided Figma design with full responsiveness and accessibility.

## 📐 Design Notes

- Fonts used:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin-Cycle-OT (provided in assets)
- Some values in the Figma design are floats — rounding is acceptable.
- Assets (images, icons) are provided in the project archives.
- The design must match the Figma file as closely as possible.

## 🎨 Interactions

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - The layout must switch to the **mobile version** when the screen width is `480px` or less.
- **Hover/Active States:**  
  - Links: `#FF6565`  
  - Buttons: `opacity: 0.9`
- **Content Width:**  
  - Maximum width: `1000px`  
  - Content must be centered on the page.
